# Deep Neural Networks from Scratch in Python
Building a simple feedforwad neural network and a convolution neural network from scratch with Python.

### Datasets:
Iris & MNIST

### Workflow:
1. Tune hyperparameters with TensorFlow
2. Rebuild networks using basic matrices
3. Optimize matrix multiplication with distributed matrix multiplcation (~~Divide & Conquer Strassen Matrix Multiplication~~ Cannon's algorithm)
